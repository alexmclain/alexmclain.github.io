I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology and
Biostatistics](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/public_health/study/areas_of_study/epidemiology_biostatistics/index.php) at the University of South Carolina. I have a broad range
of statistical interests including Bayesian methods for high-dimensional
linear regression, modeling complex longitudinal and clustered data,
length-biased survival analysis, and multiple testing. Recently, most of
my research has focused on computationally feasible Bayesian methods for
prediction, predictive inference, and variable selection for
high-dimensional regression models. My areas of application are in neuroimaging
maternal child-health, nutrition, and disease mapping (with various
outcomes). I am an Associate Editor for Statistics in
Medicine and is a Statistical Consultant for the American Journal of
Obstetrics and Gynecology, I was formerly an Associate Editor for The
American Statistician, a member of the Statistical Review Board for the
American Society of Nutrition. <br>
